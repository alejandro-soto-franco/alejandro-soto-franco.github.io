# ðŸ‘‹ Hola! :)

Iâ€™m a biomedical engineer with deep research experience at the intersection of **boundary value problems**, **liquid crystal theory**, and **computational modeling of nonlinear biological systems** at various effective length scales. My work spans is unified by a passion for precise derivation and meaningful applications in physics, biology, and engineering.

Feel free to explore some of my featured projects belowâ€”or [get in touch](#contact) if you'd like to connect or collaborate.

## ðŸš€ Projects

### [catLC: Categorical Multiscale Field Theory for Liquid Crystals](https://github.com/alejandro-soto-franco/catLC)
A foundational formalism for modeling topological and geometric features of liquid crystal systems across scales. Uses category theory, differential geometry, and type theory to unify active matter dynamics with sheaf-theoretic representations. Implemented in Rust and Lean.

### [Periodic Defect Dynamics of 2D Confined Active Nematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10880)
Published on arXiv and under review for *PRX*, this paper explores how confined active nematics develop self-organized, periodic braiding structures. It quantifies defect motion and entropy growth, and draws connections to braid theory and spectral dynamics in topological systems.

### [Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) Year-Long Project Course](https://github.com/alejandro-soto-franco/jhu-pkpd-2324)
Course-length computational research on nonlinear PK/PD models, dosing dynamics, and parameter sensitivity. Built with reproducible Jupyter notebooks and simulations, integrating experimental data and pharmacological theory.
