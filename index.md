# Alejandro Soto Franco

I‚Äôm a biomedical engineer and computational scientist focused on **nonlinear biological systems**, **field-theoretic modeling**, and **applied geometry**. My research combines **boundary value problems**, **liquid crystal physics**, and **biological inference** across multiple scales.

I build systems and models at the interface of **mathematical structure** and **biological application**, often working in Rust, Python, and Lean. Below are some selected projects and toolkits.

## üöÄ Projects

### [catLC](https://github.com/alejandro-soto-franco/catLC)  
**Categorical Multiscale Field Theory for Liquid Crystals**

A formal framework for liquid crystals and topological soft matter, grounded in category theory, differential geometry, and type theory. Models defect braiding, sheaf coupling, and scale transitions using a typed field-theoretic architecture.  
‚Üí Rust and Lean implementation.

### [Periodic Defect Dynamics of 2D Confined Active Nematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10880)  
Explores periodic braiding and spectral topology in confined active nematics. Connects real-world simulations to braid group structures and entropy dynamics.  
üìù *Under review at PRX*.

---

### [inferCNAsc](https://github.com/alejandro-soto-franco/inferCNAsc)  
**Copy Number Inference from scRNA-seq**

Python package for inferring DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) from single-cell RNA-seq data. Supports PSC genome integrity analysis and cancer lineage tracing. Built with Scanpy and AnnData.  
‚Üí Developed with Raeann Kalinowski and Amy Liu (JHU BME, Spring 2025).

---

### [PK/PD Nonlinear Models ‚Äì JHU Course Project](https://github.com/alejandro-soto-franco/jhu-pkpd-2324)  
A full-scale year-long modeling project on nonlinear pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, including multi-dose simulations and sensitivity profiling.  
‚Üí Interactive notebooks + experimental fits.

---

### [Math\_BioE](https://github.com/alejandro-soto-franco/Math_BioE)  
A living textbook on **mathematical bioengineering**. Combines differential geometry, PDEs, and variational theory for real biological systems.  
‚Üí Targeted for future open publication.

---

### [manifold_learning_fx](https://github.com/alejandro-soto-franco/manifold_learning_fx)  
Rust-based alpha signal extraction via manifold learning and spectral embeddings. Applies unsupervised methods to FX market structure analysis.  
‚Üí Part of the Œ©/rs-aurum pipeline.
