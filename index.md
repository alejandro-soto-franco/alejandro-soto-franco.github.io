# Intro

Hello! I'm **Alejandro Soto Franco**, a mathematician with an interest in differential geometry, symmetry-breaking transformations, and reinforcement learning models. I am currently employed as a research assistant in Daniel Beller's theoretical soft condensed-matter physics lab at Johns Hopkins University.

Feel free to explore my projects below or [get in touch](#contact).
